### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist focussed on Time Series Forecasting and causal Inference using python. I've worked as a Data Scientist on Prognostic and Diagnostic algorithms using multivariate IOT sensor data. Currently, I've a Patent published on one of the Algorithms.


Topics that excite me -

- Time Series Forecasting
- Causal Inference
- reproducible work & production readiness
- Model Deployment Architecture
- Unsupervised Classification
- Financial Algorithm Modelling
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Image based Deep learning models using Pytorch. So far i've succesfully used YOLO algorithm for an in house development task and still learning more about the architecture design
